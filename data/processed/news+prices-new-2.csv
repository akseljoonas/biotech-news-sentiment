SCLX,"Scilex Holding Company Sets Launch Price of $595 per 150ml bottle of Gloperba®, its First and Only Liquid Oral Version of the Anti-Gout Medicine Colchicine Indicated for the Prophylaxis of Painful Gout Flares in Adults; Expected Plans to Launch in the First Half of 2024","PALO ALTO, Calif., March  05, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  Scilex Holding Company (Nasdaq: SCLX, “Scilex” or “Company”), an innovative revenue-generating company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing non-opioid pain management products for the treatment of acute and chronic pain, today announced expected plans to launch Gloperba, its novel liquid colchicine formulation, in the first half of 2024 with a launch price of $595 per 150ml bottle. Gloperba is the only FDA approved liquid formulation of colchicine for the prophylaxis of acute gout flares. Over 70% of gout patients have chronic kidney disease and many suffer from gastrointestinal sensitivity, necessitating a lower dose of colchicine than the standard 0.6 mg tablet or capsule. Gloperba is expected to be the first liquid colchicine formulation that allows healthcare providers to prescribe precision dosing in at-risk patient populations, and thereby help mitigate against severe toxicity in patients. Healthcare providers can now safely and effectively manage such patients at doses below 0.6 mg once or twice daily, which is the standard dose for prophylaxis. In patients who are treated at lower doses than 0.6 mg, the 150 ml bottle of Gloperba is expected to last more than 30 days, delivering additional value to patients.",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/03/05/2840506/0/en/Scilex-Holding-Company-Sets-Launch-Price-of-595-per-150ml-bottle-of-Gloperba-its-First-and-Only-Liquid-Oral-Version-of-the-Anti-Gout-Medicine-Colchicine-Indicated-for-the-Prophylax.html,product___services_announcement,2024-03-05 03:00:00-0500,,,1.34,1.34,1.26,1.3,1.307697380952381,1194528.0,3210.0,1.2997883483936752,72.86,1.34,-0.007633587786259549,2.0,1.0

The 24 and 30-month stability test samples passed all chemistry and potency assays; allowing the Company to make a conservative claim of 24-month stability. The 24-month stability claim is consistent with other pegylated cytokines, such as alpha-interferon, and allows the Company to design a global supply chain using proven and established systems. With this data, the company can benefit from such existing systems that use temperature controlled and monitored shipment of liquid-formulation drugs at 2-8C, which is routine across the pharmaceutical industry.
