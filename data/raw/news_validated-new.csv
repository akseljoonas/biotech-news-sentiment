Gloperba is the only FDA approved liquid formulation of colchicine for the prophylaxis of acute gout flares. Over 70% of gout patients have chronic kidney disease and many suffer from gastrointestinal sensitivity, necessitating a lower dose of colchicine than the standard 0.6 mg tablet or capsule. Gloperba is expected to be the first liquid colchicine formulation that allows healthcare providers to prescribe precision dosing in at-risk patient populations, and thereby help mitigate against severe toxicity in patients. Healthcare providers can now safely and effectively manage such patients at doses below 0.6 mg once or twice daily, which is the standard dose for prophylaxis. In patients who are treated at lower doses than 0.6 mg, the 150 ml bottle of Gloperba is expected to last more than 30 days, delivering additional value to patients.",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/03/05/2840506/0/en/Scilex-Holding-Company-Sets-Launch-Price-of-595-per-150ml-bottle-of-Gloperba-its-First-and-Only-Liquid-Oral-Version-of-the-Anti-Gout-Medicine-Colchicine-Indicated-for-the-Prophylax.html,Product / Services Announcement,2024-03-05 03:00:00-0500,,

VALN,Valneva et Pfizer annoncent de nouvelles données positives de Phase 2 après une vaccination de rappel pour le candidat vaccin contre la maladie de Lyme,"Saint-Herblain (France) & New York, le 3 septembre 2024 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) et Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) ont annoncé aujourd’hui des données positives sur l'immunogénicité et l'innocuité de l'étude de Phase 2 VLA15-221, suite à une deuxième vaccination de rappel avec son candidat vaccin contre la maladie de Lyme, VLA15, administrée un an après la première dose de rappel. La réponse immunitaire et le profil d'innocuité de VLA15 un mois après avoir reçu cette deuxième dose de rappel étaient similaires à ceux rapportés après avoir reçu la première dose de rappel, démontrant ainsi le bénéfice potentiel que pourrait avoir une vaccination de rappel avant chaque saison de maladie de Lyme. Il n’existe actuellement aucun vaccin humain contre la maladie de Lyme et VLA15 est le candidat vaccin le plus avancé contre cette maladie, avec deux essais de Phase 3 en cours. Les centres américains de contrôle et de prévention des maladies (CDC) estiment qu'environ 476 000 personnes sont diagnostiquées et traitées contre la maladie de Lyme chaque année aux États-Unis et que 129 000 cas sont signalés chaque année en Europe.1,2",https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/03/2939282/0/fr/Valneva-et-Pfizer-annoncent-de-nouvelles-donn%C3%A9es-positives-de-Phase-2-apr%C3%A8s-une-vaccination-de-rappel-pour-le-candidat-vaccin-contre-la-maladie-de-Lyme.html,European Regulatory News,2024-09-02 19:00:00-0400,,
