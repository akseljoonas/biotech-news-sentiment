# Press Release Sentiment Analysis
In the US, 62% of adults own stocks, whether treasury bonds, stocks, commodities, or any other. The information about public companies such as earnings releases, product announcements, or financial metrics is easily accessible through the internet.

While most of those press releases consist of objective information, a clear sentiment can be extracted as the analysts almost always give an opinion on said news. This project aims to utilize automated sentiment analysis with Large Language Models to try to outpace the market and be the first in the queue to react to new information, trying to predict the market response and profit from shorting/longing the company mentioned in the news.

- There is an interesting idea of taking the last token representation of a Decoder LLM and training a classifier on top of it so you can take advantage of the big and good llms we have. https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01239
